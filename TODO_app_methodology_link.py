# TODO: Streamlit UI Implementation
# 
# When implementing app.py (PR #27), ensure the "Methodology" link in the UI header
# points to: docs/research/monte_carlo_football.pdf
#
# Per the Master Reference requirements:
# - The Simulator tab should include a small "Methodology" expander 
# - Link should point to docs/research/monte_carlo_football.pdf (canonical location)
# - See README section 19 for full implementation details
