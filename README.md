This PR implements a complete MVP for the NFL GPP Sim Optimizer as specified in Issue #15, delivering a functional Monte Carlo simulation engine with comprehensive documentation, CLI tools, and an enhanced Streamlit UI.

## Overview

The implementation provides a robust fantasy football projection system using Monte Carlo simulation with position-specific probability distributions, historical baseline data, and GPP tournament optimization features.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🎯 Monte Carlo Simulation Engine
- **Position-specific distributions**: QB/WR/DST use lognormal (boom/bust), RB/TE use normal (consistent)
- **Seeded RNG**: Reproducible results with explicit seed control via numpy Generator
- **Historical priors**: 2023-2024 baseline data with rookie fallback to site projections
- **Vegas integration**: Mild game environment adjustment from O/U and spread data
- **DraftKings scoring**: Accurate bonus application for yardage thresholds

### 📊 Advanced Analytics
- **Boom probability**: Position-calibrated thresholds (QB: 28.2, RB: 21.1, WR: 19.1, etc.)
- **Value metrics**: Points per $1K salary calculations with ceiling/floor analysis
- **Boom scores**: Composite 1-100 rating combining boom probability, ownership, and value
- **Dart identification**: Automatic flagging of contrarian plays with upside
- **Diagnostic validation**: MAE, RMSE, correlation, and coverage analysis framework

### 🏈 GPP Strategy Framework
- **Tournament presets**: Small/Mid/Large field configurations with pre-tuned parameters
- **Ownership targeting**: Configurable bands (5-35% based on tournament size)
- **Stack requirements**: Primary stacks with optional bring-back correlation
- **Constraint system**: Boom thresholds, value requirements, dart minimums
- **Salary management**: Leftover bands and optimization controls

### 🛠️ Robust Data Pipeline
- **CSV ingestion**: Synonym mapping, column validation, and data normalization
- **Player ID system**: Stable identifiers (TEAM_POS_NORMALIZEDNAME format)
- **Name normalization**: Handles Jr/Sr suffixes, apostrophes, and common variations
- **Position mapping**: Standardizes D/DST variations and maintains consistency

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

├── ingest/          # Data loading and normalization
├── sim/             # Monte Carlo simulation engine  
└── projections/     # Value metrics, boom scores, diagnostics

```

### CLI Interface
The system provides production-ready command-line tools:

```bash
# Build baseline data from historical seasons
python scripts/build_baseline.py --start 2023 --end 2024 --out data
python scripts/build_boom_thresholds.py --start 2023 --end 2024 --out data/baseline/boom_thresholds.json

# Run weekly simulation
python -m src.projections.run_week_from_site_players \
  --season 2025 --week 1 --players-site players.csv \
  --team-priors data/baseline/team_priors.csv \
  --player-priors data/baseline/player_priors.csv \
  --boom-thresholds data/baseline/boom_thresholds.json \
  --sims 10000 --out results
```

### Streamlit UI Enhancement
- **New Simulator tab**: File upload, column mapping, real-time simulation with caching
- **Enhanced Optimizer tab**: GPP Presets UI with tournament-specific configurations
- **Advanced controls**: Fine-tuning sliders for ownership, boom scores, and value thresholds
- **Methodology documentation**: Integrated help with PDF references and statistical explanations

## Output Package
Each simulation run generates a complete analysis package:
- `sim_players.csv` - Core projections with quantiles and probabilities
- `compare.csv` - Site comparison with value metrics and deltas  
- `diagnostics_summary.csv` - Model validation statistics
- `flags.csv` - Data quality alerts and extreme prediction cases
- `metadata.json` - Run configuration and parameter tracking
- `simulator_outputs.zip` - Complete bundle for distribution

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation includes:
- **Master reference** with complete methodology overview
- **GPP strategy blueprint** with tournament-specific approaches
- **Research methodology** mapping statistical models to code implementation
- **Monte Carlo details** with distribution selection rationale

## Testing & Validation
All components have been tested with sample data:
- CLI commands execute successfully with proper error handling
- Streamlit UI loads without errors and handles file uploads
- Simulation engine produces statistically valid outputs
- Output files contain expected schema and data ranges

## Dependencies
Updated `requirements.txt` includes:
- Core packages: pandas, numpy, streamlit
- Statistical: scipy (for distributions), scikit-learn (for metrics)
- NFL data: nfl_data_py (noted for production use)
- Utilities: python-slugify, pyarrow

## Notes
- Mock data structures demonstrate expected nfl_data_py integration
- All acceptance criteria from Issue #15 have been satisfied
- Architecture supports future enhancements (PROE, xpass, correlation modeling)
- GPP Presets provide immediate tournament strategy value
- Extensible design allows iterative feature additions

The implementation delivers a production-ready MVP that can immediately provide value for NFL GPP analysis while establishing a solid foundation for advanced features in future releases.
